Our own implementation of the game
”Connect Four”1 (rules described below):

The game should be implemented
preferably in Java and otherwise in C#.

It should be possible for a human
player to play against the computer, and moreover the computer should make
”reasonable” moves, i.e. it should be able to win sometimes. Therefore, letting
the computer take e.g. random moves does not count as a valid solution to this
exercise.

The computer’s response time on a board with 7 columns and 6 rows should be
”reasonable”2. On average, response time should not be longer than 10 seconds
although few moves up to 30 seconds would be acceptable.
